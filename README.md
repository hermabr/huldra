# huldra

NOTE: this is a very early prototype, expect breaking changes. for now this is mostly an idea

huldra makes it trivial to create minimal, cacheable pipelines in Python by extending [chz](https://github.com/openai/chz) classes.

all huldra objects map from a config to artifact, using nested config objects for defining the pipelines

## how to use

1. inherit from Huldra
2. define the functions `_create` for creating an object and `_load` for loading existing object
3. call the method `load_or_create` to load the object if it already exists or create if it does not already exist

## features

- [ ] stores metadata for which code generated your results and how to revert to them
- [ ] stores state for project while it is running
- [ ] integrates with submitit
